# Income Prediction App : Based on UCI Irvine Income Census Data
Project Details : 

Data Source : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income
Goal : Creating Machine Learning Model that Can Predict Whether Somebody has income above 50K per year or below 50K per year 

I divided the project into 2 seperate main objective : 
1. Data Preparation : 
  a. Downloading the data from UCI Irvine Machine Learning Datasets
  b. Reading the training data (adult.data and adult.names) in Microsoft Excell compiled them as adult_dataset income.xlsx file, while with the test data only reading adult.test and saving  it as test_adult dataset.xlsx 
  c. 
2. Model Creation : In this phase the step were break down on the notebook file model_scratch.ipynb 

3. Deploying Model : 
  Technology : 1. Flask , 2.Heroku
